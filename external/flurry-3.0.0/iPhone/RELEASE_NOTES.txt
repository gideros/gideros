Flurry iPhone SDK v3.0.0
Build: 53
Released: 7/8/11

Release notes for v3.0.0:
------------------------------------------------
The Flurry iOS 3.0.0 SDK introduces a new modularized library structure, separating Analytics API
functionality and AppCircle API functionality into FlurryAnalytics and FlurryAppCircle libraries.
Developers still get all the same functions and features as before but with the following added
advantages of a new modularized library structure:
- logical groupings of API functionality and features
- reduced overhead of application size and memory footprint with independence to linking
Advertisement libraries as desired

The FlurryAnalytics library has a new API method to optionally set session reporting requests
to HTTPS.
