                              Version 4.3


OVERVIEW

Libxmp is a library that renders module files to PCM data. It supports
over 90 mainstream and obscure module formats including Protracker (MOD),
Scream Tracker 3 (S3M), Fast Tracker II (XM), and Impulse Tracker (IT).

Many compressed module formats are supported, including popular Unix, DOS,
and Amiga file packers including gzip, bzip2, SQSH, Powerpack, etc.


LIBRARY API

See docs/libxmp.html for the library API reference. The documentation
is also available in man page and PDF formats.


SUPPORTED FORMATS

See docs/formats.txt for the list of supported formats. By default,
Noisetracker and Protracker modules are played in Protracker 3.15
style and multichannel variations in Fast Tracker II style (see
docs/tracker_notes.txt for details). Multifile formats (Startrekker AM,
Soundsmith, ALM, etc). must have all files in the same directory.


SUPPORTED PACKERS

The following formats have built-in decompressors: bz2, gz, lha, oxm, xz,
Z, zip, ArcFS, arc, MMCMP, PowerPack, !Spark, SQSH, MUSE, LZX, and S404.
Other compressed formats need helpers to be installed on the system:
mo3 (unmo3) and rar (unrar).
