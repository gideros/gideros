   To add/alter special effects, cursor over to the special effects           :
   column and use one of the following numbers/letters:                       .
                                                                              .
       0       - No effect

       1       - Slide note down (pitch bend).  Parameter gives speed of
                 slide.

 .     2       - Slide note up (pitch bend).  Parameter gives speed of slide.
 .
 .     3       - Slide to note.  This slides the LAST note played till it
 :               reaches the note given with this effect.  The parameter
 |               gives the speed of the slide.  Use parameter "00" in
 |               subsequent lines to continue the slide.
 :
 |     5       - Combined slide to note & Volume slide.  This command has
 |               the same functionality as effect 3 with parameter "00" but
 .               in this case, the parameter details a volume slide.
 |               1-49 fades the volume of the instrument down.
 |               51-99 fades the volume of the instrument up.
 |
 |     A       - Volume slide.  1-49 fades the volume of the instrument down
 |               at the given speed.  51-99 fades the volume of the
 |               instrument up at the given speed.
 |
 |     C       - Set volume.  Sets the absolute volume of the instrument.
 |               Values range from 0 (silent) to 64 (loudest).
 |
 |     D       - Break.  When RAD encounters this command it skips the rest
 |               of the pattern and moves to the next pattern as specified
 |               in the Order List.  The parameter, if given, specifies a
 |               line in the next pattern to start from.
 |               eg.  Effect "D12" would break to line 12 of the next pattern
 |                    in the Order List.
 |               This command is handy for "cutting short" a pattern if
 |               you don't want to use all 64 lines.  Just place a D00 on the
 |               last line you used and the rest will be ignored.
 |
 |     F       - Set speed.  By default RAD starts up with a speed of 6 but
 |               you can use this command to slow down and speed up the
 |               playback rate of your tune.  To understand the speed value,
 |               know that RAD uses a 50Hz timer which is delayed by the
 |               speed value between each line of the pattern.                .
 |               What this means is that, say, if you set the speed to 50,
 :               (using "F50"), then each line will play at the rate of one   .
 .               per second.  Special effects, however, are modified          .
 .               50 times a second.                                           .
